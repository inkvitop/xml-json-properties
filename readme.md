# XML JSON PROPERTIES

### Abilities
- Able to marshal and unmarshal XML.
- Able to work serialize and deserialize JSON.
- Able to read and write Properties file.

### Short description
Your domain area is air company. You should implement reading/writing air company information using different sources (XML, JSON, Properties). You should throws required exceptions based on situation with data source processing.

Please see readme.md  file in skeleton repository for detailed instructions.


### Detailed instructions
You will have following types of planes:

- Military Plane.
- Passenger Plane.

**1. You are requested to implement reading/writing from/to different data sources for a given domain. You need to implement
working with following data sources:**
- Property file.
- JSON file.
- XML file.

**2. You are requested to use following types of exceptions:**
- `DataSourceFileNotExistsException.java` - in case XML, JSON, Property file is not present by defined system path.
- `UbableToParseDataSourceException.java` - in case of any parsing error of JSON or XML(e.g. not XML file(plain text)).
- `UbableToWriteDataToSourceException.java` - in case of any writing error. This exception also need to be thrown in case of we pass NULL object for writing.

###### You are allowed:

- Create new classes/packages.
- Add new dependencies in `pom.xml`.
- Add annotations to existing classes (over fields or classes).
- Modify classes which is designed for your implementation (marked with `throw new UnsupportedOperationException("You need to implement this logic");`)

###### You are NOT allowed:

- Delete existing classes.
- Move existing classes to another package.
- Change interface of class or methods signature for existing classes.
- Delete existing dependencies in `pom.xml`.

###### Testing flow:
##### Read
Tests will generate sample of XML, JSON, Property and call your correspondent reader passing following info into a constructor:
- Absolute path to the file.
##### Write
Tests will generate expected XML, JSON, Property file. Then it will create correspondent writer passing following info into a constructor:
- Absolute path to the file.

After that it will call write method and pass as argument following info:
- `Aircompany` object to write into file.

Finally test will compare generated expected file with file that was created as result of calling write method of correspondent writer.

##### JSON example
Json  represents JSON Array of planes. For Military planes field `Capacity` is always NULL (not applicable for that type of plane).
For passenger plane field `MilitaryType` is always NULL. To identify type of plane use `Type` field.

```
[
  {
    "MilitaryType": "BOMBER",
    "Speed": 1050,
    "Type": "military",
    "Capacity": null,
    "Model": "B-1B Lancer",
    "Distance": 21000
  },
  {
    "MilitaryType": null,
    "Speed": 940,
    "Type": "passenger",
    "Capacity": 192,
    "Model": "Boeing-737-800",
    "Distance": 63870
  }
```
---
##### XML example
Main xml element is `<planes>`. This element has two types of child elements `<MilitaryPlane>` and `<PassengerPlane>` depending on type of plane.
Military plan doesn't have `<Capacity>` field. Passenger plane doesn't have `<MilitaryType>` field.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<planes>
    <MilitaryPlane model="B-1B Lancer">
        <MilitaryType>BOMBER</MilitaryType>
        <Speed>1050</Speed>
        <Distance>21000</Distance>
    </MilitaryPlane>
    <PassengerPlane model="Boeing-737">
        <Capacity>164</Capacity>
        <Speed>900</Speed>
        <Distance>60500</Distance>
    </PassengerPlane>
</planes>
```
---
##### Property example
Property file represent list of planes. Each plane has set of properties which starts with `plane${index}`. For Military planes property `capacity` is missed (not applicable for that type of plane).
For passenger planes property `militaryType` is missed (not applicable for that type of plane).
